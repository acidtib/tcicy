# TCG Card Scanner Experimental Repository

## Current Status

Experimental/Development

## Note

This repository is a learning project, and the code is not intended for production use. It is a collection of experiments and proof-of-concepts.

## Components

* `fetch_magic.rb`: A script to download the training dataset for Magic: The Gathering cards.
* (Future plans) Model training and prediction scripts using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements

* Ruby (for the `fetch_magic.rb` script)
* TensorFlow and Keras (for future model training and prediction scripts)

## Usage

1. Run `fetch_magic.rb` to download the training dataset.
2. (Future plans) Train the model using the downloaded dataset.
3. (Future plans) Use the trained model to make predictions and gather information about TCG cards.
